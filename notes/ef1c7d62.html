        <div>这段文字探讨了人们在追求爱情时常常陷入的一种误区：将被选择、被认可视为自我价值的体现。作者指出，许多人误以为被难以接近或情感上不可得的人选中，是自我价值的证明。这种心态往往源于早期经历，如需要通过表现来赢得父母或其他重要人物的认可。真正的爱情应该是平静而稳定的，而不是一场持续的表演或征服。要从追求验证转向真正接受爱，首先需要哀悼那个认为自己必须被渴望才能被珍惜的自己，然后学会不再将爱情视为奖励系统，停止不断表演和追求，而是允许自己变得平凡，真实地展现自我。最终，个人的力量来源于认识到自己的价值不依赖于他人的选择，而是源自内心深处对自我的接纳与肯定。</div>

    <div class="content">You don't actually want love. Not yet. What you want, what you've been chasing, is to be picked, chosen, validated. You want someone to point out to you and say, you, you're rich. You're finnienough. Now I see you. I choose you because somewhere deep down in your system, you internalized a very dangerous equation. To be chosen is to be safe. To be desired is to be valuable. To be wanted is to be worthy. And anything that threatens that equation, anything that reminds you that real love is quiet and steady, he rejects ected because being picked by someone you had to earn, especially someone emotionally unavailable, chaotic, hard to impress, that feels like redemption, that feels like healing. It's not. It's just another performance. You know what's less, rewind. Because this didn't start with romanance. This started long before. Maybe was a parent whose love you had to earn, a caregiver who praised you only when you were useful, but never when you were hurting, a family system that rewarded performance and punished emotional needs. So you adapted. You learned to be easy, charming, smart, helpful, pleasant, never too much. You became whoever you needed to be just to avoid abandonment. You became the version of yourself that was most likely to be chosen, and the version of you that wasn't. You buried them. Now you're grown, but the world remains. You say you want love, but what you mean is validation. You say you want partnership, but you mean a witness who will finally say you're good enough. You mistake anxiety for chemistry. You mistake distance for mystery. You mistake someone's unpredictability for a challenge you need to win, because deep down you believe that the harder they are to earn, the more valuable you must be if they choose you. So you chase unavailable people and call its fate. You pine naas, the one who wants text back and call its romantic tension. You ignore the steady love that feels unfamiliar, because deep down your nervous system is wired for chaos. Let me say this as clearly as possible. You are not addicted to love. You are addicted to performance. You are addicted to pursuit. You are addicted to trying to prove that you are enough. And love grounded, emotionally secure love. It won't make you prove anything, which is why it feels boring for ing off, because real love doesn't Spike your nervous system. It doesn't trigger your flight or fghts. It doesn't make you question your worth every five minutes. Real love doesn't feel like conquest. It feels like home. And to someone who was raised to perform, home feels suspicious because it doesn't ask you to earn it. So, my darling, what are you really afraid of? Because you're not afraid of rejection. You are afraid of being seen without the sparkle. You are afraid of being held when you're not impressive. You are afraid of being truly known. Because what if? What if when you finally stop performing, no one stays? What if when the mask comes off, the love disappears? That's the cold wound. That's the haunting fear. So you keep reaching for the fantasy. If I can get that person to choose me, that person, the avoidant one, the emotionally distant one, the one who doesn't choose anyone, that maybe I'm finally good enough. But that's not healing. That's self abandonment in disguise. That's tying your worth to someone else's inability to love properly. You don't want to be loved. You want to be exceptional. You want to be the one who changed them. You want to be the one they couldn't ignore. You want to be the person who finally got through to someone who would never let anyone else end. Because if you can earn the love of the emotionally unavailable, then maybe finally you can stop doubting yourself. You can stop asking what's wrong with you. But this is where the whole thing collapses, my love. Because even if they choose you, you still won't believe it. Because the words ods didn't begin with them. It began with you. And no one can love you into healing the parts of yourself you refuse to meet. So how do you heal this? How do you go from chasing validation to actually letting yourself belloved ved? First you grieve. You grieved yourself who thought she had to be desirable to be kept. You grieved the little girl who believed she had to be perfect to be loved. You grieved the teenage version of you who thought being picked was proof of her value. And then you unlearn. You stop turning love into a reward system. You stop auditioning. You stop trying to be the most, the smartest, the sexiest, the easiest, the least complicated, the most healed. You stop treating relationships like a test you need to PaaS. You stop making your personality a resume, and you start doing the unthinkable. You let yourself be ordinary. You let yourself be seen. You stop looking for someone to come and pick you and start choosing yourself. You feel the heartbreak of how much energy you spent contorting, performing, earning, chasing. You let yourself be angry, you let yourself be messy, you let yourself mourn all the versions of you that we are lovable but was never loved, and you begin to ask the question, what does love look like when it's not rooted in pain? You learn to sit still, to feel lonely and not making mean anything about your worth. You stop playing to the people who confuse you, because now you see clearly that confusion is not connection. You stop needing to be impressive, you start being real and you will hurt because your nervous system doesn't know what to do with peace. You ache for the highs and lows of the chase, but you keep choosing the quiet because now you're no longer asking for love to rescue you from yourself. And when someone walks away, you don' T Chase. You let them. Because they leaving doesn't mean you're unworthy. It means you're not their person. And that doesn't have to destroy you. It doesn't have to destroy you, my darling. And here's what healing looks like. It looks like being okay when no one texts back. It looks like not attaching your worth to how wanted you feel. It looks like letting someone love you on your average days, hello, not just your best ones. It looks like falling apart and not apologizing for it. It looks like no longer chasing people who make you feel small just so you can prove that you're worthy of being seen. Because here's the truth that changes everything. You were never meant to be picked. You were supposed to be seen. You were supposed to be known. You were supposed to be loved in your being, not in your performance. And the second you accept this, you become powerful. Because now you're not just waiting to be chosen. You are choosing. You are choosing who gets your energy, who gets your softness, who gets to stay. And most importantly, you finally choose you, not because someone else said you are worthy, but because now you know it. As always, it's been an absolute pleasure. </div>
