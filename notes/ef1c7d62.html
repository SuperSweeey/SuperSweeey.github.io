            <div>这段文字探讨了人们在追求爱情时常常陷入的一种误区：将被选择、被认可视为自我价值的体现。作者指出，许多人误以为被难以接近或情感上不可得的人选中，是自我价值的证明。这种心态往往源于早期经历，如需要通过表现来赢得父母或其他重要人物的认可。真正的爱情应该是平静而稳定的，而不是一场持续的表演或征服。要从追求验证转向真正接受爱，首先需要哀悼那个认为自己必须被渴望才能被珍惜的自己，然后学会不再将爱情视为奖励系统，停止不断表演和追求，而是允许自己变得平凡，真实地展现自我。最终，个人的力量来源于认识到自己的价值不依赖于他人的选择，而是源自内心深处对自我的接纳与肯定。</div>

        <h3>📝 英文原文</h3>
You don't actually want love. Not yet. What you want, what you've been chasing, is to be picked, chosen, validated. You want someone to point out to you and say, you, you're rich. You're finnienough. Now I see you. I choose you because somewhere deep down in your system, you internalized a very dangerous equation. To be chosen is to be safe. To be desired is to be valuable. To be wanted is to be worthy. And anything that threatens that equation, anything that reminds you that real love is quiet and steady, he rejects ected because being picked by someone you had to earn, especially someone emotionally unavailable, chaotic, hard to impress, that feels like redemption, that feels like healing. It's not. It's just another performance. You know what's less, rewind. Because this didn't start with romanance. This started long before. Maybe was a parent whose love you had to earn, a caregiver who praised you only when you were useful, but never when you were hurting, a family system that rewarded performance and punished emotional needs. So you adapted. You learned to be easy, charming, smart, helpful, pleasant, never too much. You became whoever you needed to be just to avoid abandonment. You became the version of yourself that was most likely to be chosen, and the version of you that wasn't. You buried them. Now you're grown, but the world remains. You say you want love, but what you mean is validation. You say you want partnership, but you mean a witness who will finally say you're good enough. You mistake anxiety for chemistry. You mistake distance for mystery. You mistake someone's unpredictability for a challenge you need to win, because deep down you believe that the harder they are to earn, the more valuable you must be if they choose you. So you chase unavailable people and call its fate. You pine naas, the one who wants text back and call its romantic tension. You ignore the steady love that feels unfamiliar, because deep down your nervous system is wired for chaos. Let me say this as clearly as possible. You are not addicted to love. You are addicted to performance. You are addicted to pursuit. You are addicted to trying to prove that you are enough. And love grounded, emotionally secure love. It won't make you prove anything, which is why it feels boring for ing off, because real love doesn't Spike your nervous system. It doesn't trigger your flight or fghts. It doesn't make you question your worth every five minutes. Real love doesn't feel like conquest. It feels like home. And to someone who was raised to perform, home feels suspicious because it doesn't ask you to earn it. So, my darling, what are you really afraid of? Because you're not afraid of rejection. You are afraid of being seen without the sparkle. You are afraid of being held when you're not impressive. You are afraid of being truly known. Because what if? What if when you finally stop performing, no one stays? What if when the mask comes off, the love disappears? That's the cold wound. That's the haunting fear. So you keep reaching for the fantasy. If I can get that person to choose me, that person, the avoidant one, the emotionally distant one, the one who doesn't choose anyone, that maybe I'm finally good enough. But that's not healing. That's self abandonment in disguise. That's tying your worth to someone else's inability to love properly. You don't want to be loved. You want to be exceptional. You want to be the one who changed them. You want to be the one they couldn't ignore. You want to be the person who finally got through to someone who would never let anyone else end. Because if you can earn the love of the emotionally unavailable, then maybe finally you can stop doubting yourself. You can stop asking what's wrong with you. But this is where the whole thing collapses, my love. Because even if they choose you, you still won't believe it. Because the words ods didn't begin with them. It began with you. And no one can love you into healing the parts of yourself you refuse to meet. So how do you heal this? How do you go from chasing validation to actually letting yourself belloved ved? First you grieve. You grieved yourself who thought she had to be desirable to be kept. You grieved the little girl who believed she had to be perfect to be loved. You grieved the teenage version of you who thought being picked was proof of her value. And then you unlearn. You stop turning love into a reward system. You stop auditioning. You stop trying to be the most, the smartest, the sexiest, the easiest, the least complicated, the most healed. You stop treating relationships like a test you need to PaaS. You stop making your personality a resume, and you start doing the unthinkable. You let yourself be ordinary. You let yourself be seen. You stop looking for someone to come and pick you and start choosing yourself. You feel the heartbreak of how much energy you spent contorting, performing, earning, chasing. You let yourself be angry, you let yourself be messy, you let yourself mourn all the versions of you that we are lovable but was never loved, and you begin to ask the question, what does love look like when it's not rooted in pain? You learn to sit still, to feel lonely and not making mean anything about your worth. You stop playing to the people who confuse you, because now you see clearly that confusion is not connection. You stop needing to be impressive, you start being real and you will hurt because your nervous system doesn't know what to do with peace. You ache for the highs and lows of the chase, but you keep choosing the quiet because now you're no longer asking for love to rescue you from yourself. And when someone walks away, you don' T Chase. You let them. Because they leaving doesn't mean you're unworthy. It means you're not their person. And that doesn't have to destroy you. It doesn't have to destroy you, my darling. And here's what healing looks like. It looks like being okay when no one texts back. It looks like not attaching your worth to how wanted you feel. It looks like letting someone love you on your average days, hello, not just your best ones. It looks like falling apart and not apologizing for it. It looks like no longer chasing people who make you feel small just so you can prove that you're worthy of being seen. Because here's the truth that changes everything. You were never meant to be picked. You were supposed to be seen. You were supposed to be known. You were supposed to be loved in your being, not in your performance. And the second you accept this, you become powerful. Because now you're not just waiting to be chosen. You are choosing. You are choosing who gets your energy, who gets your softness, who gets to stay. And most importantly, you finally choose you, not because someone else said you are worthy, but because now you know it. As always, it's been an absolute pleasure.

        <h3>🇨🇳 中文翻译</h3>
你其实并不想要爱。至少现在还不是。你想要的，你一直在追逐的，是被选中、被选择、被认可。你想要有人指着你说，就是你，你足够富有。你足够好。现在我看到你了。我选择你，因为在你内心深处，你内化了一个非常危险的等式。被选中就是安全。被渴望就是有价值。被需要就是值得被爱。任何威胁到这个等式的事物，任何提醒你真正的爱是平静而稳定的事物，都会被你拒绝，因为被一个你需要努力赢得的人选中，尤其是那个情感上不可得、混乱、难以打动的人，那感觉就像救赎，那感觉就像治愈。但其实不是。那只是另一场表演。你知道吗，让我们倒带。因为这不是从爱情开始的。这早在很久之前就开始了。也许是一个你需要去赢得其爱的父母，一个只在你有用时才表扬你、但在你受伤时从不安慰你的照顾者，一个奖励表现却惩罚情感需求的家庭系统。所以你适应了。你学会了变得随和、迷人、聪明、有帮助、令人愉快，从不过分。你变成了任何你需要成为的人，只是为了避免被抛弃。你变成了那个最有可能被选中的版本的自己，而那个不被选中的版本，你把它们埋葬了。现在你长大了，但这个模式依然存在。你说你想要爱，但你真正的意思是认可。你说你想要伴侣关系，但你真正的意思是一个最终会说你足够好的见证者。你把焦虑误认为是化学反应。你把距离误认为是神秘感。你把某人的不可预测性误认为是你需要赢得的挑战，因为在内心深处，你相信他们越难赢得，如果他们选择了你，你就一定越有价值。所以你追逐那些不可得的人，并称其为命运。你为那个不回消息的人憔悴，并称其为浪漫张力。你忽视那种感觉陌生的稳定的爱，因为在内心深处，你的神经系统为混乱而 wired。让我尽可能清楚地说出来。你不是对爱上瘾。你是对表演上瘾。你是对追逐上瘾。你是对试图证明自己足够好上瘾。而那种扎根的、情感上安全的爱，它不会让你证明任何事情，这就是为什么它感觉无聊或让人不安，因为真正的爱不会刺激你的神经系统。它不会触发你的战斗或逃跑反应。它不会让你每五分钟就质疑自己的价值。真正的爱感觉不像征服。它感觉像家。而对于一个被教育要表演的人来说，家感觉可疑，因为它不要求你去赢得它。所以，亲爱的，你真正害怕的是什么？因为你不是害怕拒绝。你害怕的是没有光芒时被看到。你害怕的是不引人注目时被拥抱。你害怕的是被真正了解。因为如果呢？如果当你终于停止表演时，没有人留下来？如果当面具摘下时，爱消失了？那是冰冷的伤口。那是萦绕心头的恐惧。所以你一直伸手去抓那个幻想。如果我能让那个人选择我，那个人，那个回避型的人，那个情感上疏远的人，那个不选择任何人的人，那么也许我终于足够好了。但那不是治愈。那是伪装的自我抛弃。那是把你的价值绑在别人无法正确去爱的能力上。你不想要被爱。你想要变得特别。你想要那个改变了他们的人。你想要那个他们无法忽视的人。你想要那个终于能走进那个从不允许任何人靠近的人心里的人。因为如果你能赢得那个情感上不可得的人的爱，那么也许你终于可以停止怀疑自己。你可以停止问自己哪里出了问题。但这就是整个事情崩塌的地方，我的爱。因为即使他们选择了你，你仍然不会相信。因为问题不是从他们开始的。是从你开始的。没有人能通过爱你来治愈你拒绝面对的那部分自己。那么你如何治愈这个呢？你如何从追逐认可转向真正让自己被爱？首先你要哀悼。你哀悼那个认为自己必须被渴望才能被留下的自己。你哀悼那个相信自己必须完美才能被爱的小女孩。你哀悼那个认为被选中就是她价值证明的少年版的你。然后你要去学习。你停止把爱变成一个奖励系统。你停止试镜。你停止试图成为最棒的、最聪明的、最性感的、最随和的、最简单的、最治愈的。你停止把关系当成一个你需要通过的测试。你停止把你的个性变成一份简历，然后你开始做那件不可想象的事。你让自己变得平凡。你让自己被看到。你停止寻找 someone 来选择你，开始选择你自己。你感受到那种心痛，关于你花了多少能量去扭曲、表演、赢得、追逐。你让自己愤怒，你让自己混乱，你让自己哀悼所有那些可爱但从未被爱过的版本的你，然后你开始问这个问题：当爱不扎根于痛苦时，它是什么样子？你学会静坐，学会感受孤独而不让它意味着任何关于你价值的事情。你停止和那些让你困惑的人玩游戏，因为现在你清楚地看到困惑不是连接。你停止需要变得引人注目，你开始变得真实，而你会受伤，因为你的神经系统不知道如何处理平静。你渴望追逐的高潮和低谷，但你继续选择平静，因为现在你不再要求爱来把你从自己中拯救出来。而当有人离开时，你不要去追。你让他们走。因为他们离开不意味着你不值得。它意味着你不是他们的那个人。而那不必摧毁你。那不必摧毁你，亲爱的。而这就是治愈的样子。它看起来像是当没有人回消息时你没事。它看起来像是不把你的价值和你感觉有多被需要绑在一起。它看起来像是让某人在你平凡的日子里爱你，而不只是你最好的日子里。它看起来像是崩溃而不为此道歉。它看起来像是不再追逐那些让你觉得渺小的人，只是为了证明你值得被看到。因为这就是改变一切的真相。你从来都不是为了被选中而生的。你是为了被看到而生的。你是为了被了解而生的。你是为了在你的存在中被爱，而不是在你的表演中被爱而生的。而你接受这一点的那一刻，你就变得强大了。因为现在你不只是在等待被选择。你在选择。你在选择谁得到你的能量，谁得到你的柔软，谁可以留下来。而最重要的是，你终于选择了你自己，不是因为别人说你值得，而是因为现在你知道了。一如既往，这绝对是一种荣幸。
